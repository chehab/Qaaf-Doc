## ￼Preface

Updating the software in Embedded Devices especially after the production and distribution of the product is not an easy task, In fact it’s rarely heard of except for High-Risk[^1] product like in Aircrafts, Automotive and heavy machinery Or media devices with internet, computer access like Smart TVs, Media Players and Cell-Phones.

This is as result of a oblivion of a standard programming interface for microcontrollers, The fragmentation in the programming interfaces in a single MCU[^2] manufacturer is vast not to mention custom MCU.
